This is a point mass model of a seaglider that produces information such as the power draw, max speed and glide period of a Seaglider using a ballast pump and tank and an expanding volume.
We had to use CFD to get the CL and CD for our glider geometries. We started with a Myring Hull and a hydrostatic balance with our expected vehicle mass.
